# SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Design

Read this study and answer the questions at the end. The "Additional Resources"
are optional, but highly recommended.

## Design Principles

> Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. — [Brian
> Kernighan](http://genius.cat-v.org/brian-kernighan/)

A developer's job is managing complexity. More complex systems fail more often,
are more expensive to maintain, and are difficult to understand. Less complex
systems are systems well-suited to change.

Complexity is a function of dependencies. A complex system is tightly coupled,
with changes rippling throughout the entire system. A simple system has
clearly-identifiable dependencies that are not affected by change.

Have you ever dreaded changing some code for fear it might break something you
won't know how to fix? Part of the blame might lie in you, in your
understanding, but the antidote for that is more practice and exposure to design
principles. The majority of the blame probably lies in a complex system that you
can't fully understand. The antidote is the same.

Less complex systems are well-designed, and well-designed systems are easier to
learn. This makes these systems resilient to change, since it is easier to trace
the effects of a change and potentially stop the propagation of change with a
well-placed abstraction. Well-designed systems help us manage our expectations,
and managing our expectations is a crucial part of approaching code with
confidence.

Some characteristics of poorly defined systems:

> -   Rigid (difficult to change)
> -   Fragile (tendency to break when changed)
> -   Immobile (limited reuse of components)
> -   Viscous (easier to do it "wrong" than "right")

Bob Martin is much smarter than me: he has identified patterns in poorly-defined
software **and** recommended some principles that can guide us on our way to
better design. These principles are abbreviated SOLID.

Design principles are goals. The strategies we employ in writing code that can
be described by these principles are called "refactorings". Often, we can
recognize bad patterns in the code we write by "code smells". So, design
principles provide us a framework for structuring our work. The cycle for
improving our code will look like this:

1.  Identify an issue with your code, usually by the presence of a code smell.
1.  Extract methods and classes to better define responsibilities.
1.  Inject our new code into our old code so behavior doesn't change.
1.  Repeat as necessary.

This is inherently an iterative process. This process is made easier by the
presence of automated tests, but at the very least we should manually exercise
the part of our codebase that is changing to ensure our system still works.

## SOLID

[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29) is an
acronym that stands for:

-   [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
-   [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle)
-   [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)
-   [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
-   [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)

These principles are presented and defined separately, but in practice they work
together. For example, we might initially extract a class to improve adherence
to SRP, and in the process we practice DIP so our code doesn't break.

ISP states that "many client-specific interfaces are better than one
general-purpose interface". That means it is better to have many small, focused
objects in our system than to have one general purpose object.

Fortunately, since we use dynamically-typed languages like Ruby and JavaScript,
we get ISP for free through duck-typing. We don't have explicit object
interfaces in Ruby, for example. Instead, we have objects that do or do not
respond to certain messages. Instead of an explicit interface, we have an
implicit protocol. In statically-typed languages, ISP allows us to more easily
compose objects together to get the behavior we want. All we have to do to
achieve ISP is focus on SRP (and DIP).

LSP is another principle we don't have to think much about. LSP says that
"subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes". For example, things
we call "Sedans" should behave like "Vehicles", though the former may be more
specific. This is similar to the mantra we've repeated in the past about
relationships between different concepts: "all squares are rectangles but not
all rectangles are squares".

```ruby
class Rectangle
  attr_reader :number_of_sides, :length, :width

  def initialize(length, width)
    @number_of_sides = 4
    @length, @width = length, width
  end
end

class Square < Rectangle
  def initialize(side)
    super
    @length = side
    @width = side
  end
end

# Suppose we just want a four-sided object. Any will do.
def is_four_sided?(obj)
  obj.number_of_sides == 4
end

is_four_sided?(Rectangle.new(2,3))
is_four_sided?(Square.new(5))

# Does this code adhere to LSP when the client wants a four-sided object?
# Yes, both of these objects will work because of Duck-typing.  Squares behave the same as Rectangles in terms of side-number.
# What if the client wants a four-sided object with equal sides?
# If the client wants to be more specific, it can request a square, which will, again, behave the same way with regard to number of sides, but in addition will have the feature of equal side length.
```

OCP can be thought of as the primary goal of good design. OCP says that "objects
should be open to extension, but closed to modification". If our objects conform
to OCP, they're more easily composable. What this means is that we should be
able to take an object and extend it with new behavior. If we can't create new
object to obtain the behavior we want **without** opening the extended
class/module, we're not adhering to OCP. Ruby makes it really easy for us to
extend objects through inheritance and mixins. Again, we can achieve OCP by
focusing on SRP and DIP.

SRP says that "objects should have one and only one reason to change". If an
object has more than one job, it increases the likelihood that any particular
feature request will cause it change. Objects with the most responsibilities
change the most often in our system. Since our goal is managing change and
reducing complexity, this might be the most important tool we have when
refactoring. If you describe an object's responsibilities in English and you
have to use "and" or "or", it does not have a single responsibility. We may even
notice "and" or "or" in our specs or method names. This is a huge code smell!
Focus on grouping related behavior together and extracting it into another
object.

Finally, DIP states to "depend upon abstractions, not concretions". For example,
a general purpose configuration object in our system should not care about how
specific business models are implemented. Instead, those specific business
models are allowed to depend on the general configuration object to configure
their behavior. In practice, achieving DIP is as simple as injecting an object
with a general purpose back into a specific object after extracting a class.

## Heuristics

Heuristics is ten-dollar word for "rules of thumb". Use these rules as guiding
principles as you code. Most initial code you write will not meet these
criteria, but any refactorings you do should tend toward compliance with these
rules.

### [Sandi Metz' Rules](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)

> 1.  Your class can be no longer than 100 lines of code.
> 1.  Your methods can be no longer than five lines of code.
> 1.  You can pass no more than four parameters and you can’t just make it one
>     big hash.
> 1.  When a call comes into your Rails controller, you can only instantiate one
>     object to do whatever it is that needs to be done. And your view can only
>     know about one instance variable.
>
> You can break these rules if you can talk your pair into agreeing with you.

The Bike Shed podcast has a great [episode](http://bikeshed.fm/1) detailing the
experience of applying these rules on a real project.

### Questions

Ask yourself the following questions when you get ready to refactor your code.
If the answer is "no" to any of these questions, start by addressing that issue
and see where your refactorings lead you.

-   Is it DRY?
-   Does it have one responsibility?
-   Does everything change at the same rate?
-   Does it depend on things that change less often than it does?

## Going Slow to Go Fast

You're probably thinking, "Why would I do this? It's too slow and it will take
forever." Yes it is slow, especially at first. Design is difficult. Testing is
hard. Both good design and testing feed into each other, and result in apps that
are easier to maintain over time. Initially, not thinking about design or
testing will let you move faster, but as time goes on they become crucial to
being able to maintain development speed and user happiness. You shouldn't worry
about design if you expect your project to fail, but:

> If you're an apparent success, if you've gotten enough features out the door
> that people want and you don't design, you can guarantee you will fail later
> when people ask you change it. – Sandi Metz

## Explain Why Good Software Design is Important

In your own words, explain why good design is important.

```md
Good design is important because it keeps code easy to maintain.  Maintain against what you ask?  If it works, doesn't it just work and will keep working?  No.  No, No, No.  API's change; browsers change; packages become deprecated; entire languages can be bought by companies that drastically change and/or restrict their usage; Your code needs to be able to survive these if it's going to last in the wild.  What if you want to add a feature to your product?  A well designed structure makes itself easy to add to.  What if a dependency changes, and many of your modules relied upon it?  A poorly designed system will break because it might have depended upon this module in many places in complex ways, and then you will spend an inordinate amount of time trying to track down each of the bugs from the latent infestation that you wrote into existence in the first place.
```

## Identify Good Design

List some criteria for well-designed code. Contrast this list with indicators
of poor design.

```md
Small classes.  Small objects.  Small functions.  Small modules.  Small systems.
Short lines of code.  Variables and functions that are named as if you were naming your first-born child.  Short comments that only describe what is not already obvious from the naming and structure of the code, which should be written to be understandable from a glance.  "The only truly good comment is the comment you found a way not to write."

Reuse your objects, classes, and functions as much as you can.  If you wrote them well in the first place, then you can continually reap the benefits by not having to write the same thing again, allowing you more time to get it right in the first place.

Your programs should be fully modular and adehere to SRP - each function should do one and only one thing.  If possible, avoid passing arguments, and if you absolutely need to, pass no more than 2.  If you REALLY need to, 3 should be the maximum number of arguments, but you should start to feel bad about yourself and be thinking of a way to re-write the function.  Your code should look like someone cared for it through the process of writing and refactoring.  It should feel clean.  It shouldn't have any smells to it (something that gives you a bad feeling when you look at it).

Bad design is when you look at code and cannot understand it from a glance.  The names are inconsistent and vague.  There are comments that explain the functions, but you cannot see how they work on your own.  You have to do a lot of "double-takes," and check back at the method definitions to see what it's actually doing.  It's not intuitive.  You might notice repeats of the same functionality, even if it's only a small occurrence where you could have substituted in a helper function.  The layout of the functions does not flow in any order, and your eyes have to jump around the file a lot to understand it.  Bad code makes you anxious about trying to change the slightest detail about it.
```

## Design Heuristics

Are heuristics the same thing as rules? What are some design heuristics you can
use to improve the design of your code?

```md
Heuristics aren't rules, but they're good enough.  Examples would be not having your lines of code extend past 100 characters (for some its 80, for others its 120.  It doesn't matter as long as SOME number is defined by the team and adhered to throughout the project).  Methods should be no more than 5 lines of code.  If it goes beyond that, break up the method into smaller methods.  You really shouldn't pass any more than 3 parameters to a function.  At the system level, your modules should not have unnecessary cross-talk with each other.  There should be a common interface, such as a model that they can all interact with.
```

## Refactorings

Describe some common, named refactorings you can use to approach a good design.

```md
Extract class: breaking up a large class into other classes.  This can either be a 'push down' (moving functionality to a subclass), or a 'pull up' (moving functionality to a superclass).

Generalize Type: create more general object types (classes) to increase flexibility where those objects can be used.

Replace conditions/switch/if-else chains with polymorphism.

Renaming

Encapsulating field: This is where you force your functions to access data through accessors and mutators rather than just passing around variables willy-nilly.
```
